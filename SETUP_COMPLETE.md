# ✅ Setup Complete!

All dependencies have been installed in a virtual environment.

## 🚀 How to Use the Project

### **Important: Always Activate Virtual Environment First!**

Before running any commands, you must activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You'll know it's activated when you see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

## 📝 Correct Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **1. Activate Virtual Environment**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **2. Run Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/stock_analysis.ipynb
```
(Don't copy the `#` comments - those are just explanations!)

```bash
python cli_report.py AAPL MSFT GOOGL AMZN TSLA
```

### **4. Launch Streamlit Dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't copy `#` comment lines** - Those are just explanations, not commands
2. **Always activate venv first** - Commands won't work without it
3. **Use `python3` or `python`** - Both should work after activating venv

## 📚 Next Steps

1. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Try the dashboard: `streamlit run app.py`
3. Or explore the notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/stock_analysis.ipynb`

Happy analyzing! 📈
